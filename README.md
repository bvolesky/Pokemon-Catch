## Learnings
Embarking on the journey of developing 'Pokémon Catch' was a fulfillment of a long-held aspiration. The dream of crafting a game, particularly one inspired by the world of Pokémon, has always been a part of my bucket list, and achieving this milestone has been immensely gratifying.

Developing 'Pokémon Catch' was an enlightening experience that revealed the multifaceted nature of game creation. As the project's sole developer, I engaged in every stage of its development. This process began with brainstorming the game's fast-paced design on a whiteboard and extended to creating visual aspects, such as designing and custom animating player/object sprites, the world map, splash pages, and menu screens. Additionally, I integrated 151 animated sprites and audio elements. My responsibilities also included coding the entire game, dealing with the complexities of trigonometry and mathematics, utilizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), maintaining separation of concerns, and fixing numerous bugs. I added features, performed user testing in different states, and integrated feedback into the game. The design and implementation of these aspects was an enriching and enjoyable journey, filled with rewarding challenges and valuable learning opportunities.

An 'aha' moment during development was the discovery of how character movement in games is often an illusion: it's not the character that moves, but the map underneath that shifts. This insight fundamentally changed my approach to game design and added a new layer of understanding to the mechanics of game development.

The release of 'Pokémon Catch' marks not just the culmination of this project but also the start of an exciting journey. I am thrilled with the outcome and eagerly look forward to sharing this experience with you. I hope 'Pokémon Catch' brings as much joy and excitement to you as it has brought to me during its creation.
